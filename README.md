#Demystifying Machine Learning - Predicting Home Prices

##Purpose
The objective of our project was to create an interactive experience where users of our website can visualize home prices across much of the U.S. and run home price predictions through a html form. 

##ETL
We obtained the initial data from Kaggle dataset derived from realtor.com. This dataset was chosen for several reasons including the following:
- The dataset was large and therefore was desirable because it could train using a large set of data.
- The features within the dataset were broad enough to capture many different variations of homes.

We then used S3 to house the data due to its large size which GitHub wouldnâ€™t accept. The data was then read into a notebook through Pyspark where the rest of the team would work on the data from there.
